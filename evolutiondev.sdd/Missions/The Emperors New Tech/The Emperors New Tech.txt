The Emperors New Tech
Engineer Marbuk, you have accepted this mission even though the odds are highly stacked against you. You are to be commended for your loyalty and service.

We had previously gotten reports of the colony here on Industrial Prime working on some new technology. Turns out that it is a new, compact, supertank. A few of our spies were able to bribe their way to get close enough to the crew of this supertank, and for a hefty sum have agreed to defect.

There is a slight problem, however. We have no way to airlift the tank out quietly, as it is made of superdense material and our lifters may not be able to clear the tall spires, and going around them is suicide.

This is where you come in, Engineer Marbuk. You are to stealth your way in and rendevous with the supertank and it's crew, Codenamed: Flash

We cannot afford for the enemy to find out that it was we who stole the Flash tank, so we can not afford to allow you to build more than rudimentary powerplants and defenses, radar towers and radar jammers, as anything else, if caught, could be taken as an invasion and would spark an all-out war.

Godspeed, Engineer Marbuk!
